# Tic_Tac_Toe project using python
A classic Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns marking a 3x3 grid   with their symbols (X or O). The objective is to be the first to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 


# Project Outcomes
Design and implement a user interface that allows players to interact with the game. Develop the core logic to handle player turns, check for win conditions, and detect draws.
